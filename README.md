# Hedera DLT x Data Analytics

This repository showcases an architectural diagram demonstrating how Hederaâ€™s Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) integrates with legacy data systems to enhance data analytics.

Diagram Summary:
- Smart Contract Service (HSCS):Validates and enforces rules.
- Token Service (HTS):Tokenizes verified data for traceability.
- Consensus Service (HCS):Logs immutable data events.

This concept was built for the Hedera Data Analytics Bounty demonstrating the potential of DLT-driven analytics workflows.
